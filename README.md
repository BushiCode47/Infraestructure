# Infrastructure Deployment & Configuration Templates

This repository is organized around the configuration and deployment of infrastructure based on the technologies, languages, and tools used.

## Overview

- **Generic Templates**:  
  Complete and generic templates covering broad infrastructure setups.

- **Specific Templates**:  
  Tailored templates for particular use cases, each accompanied by a comprehensive tutorial on implementation.

## Folder Structure

Each main folder contains its own `README.md` that explains the folder's structure. Additionally, every template includes a `README.md` detailing:
- **Design Rationale**: Why the template was created in this particular way.
- **Usage Instructions**: How to use and implement the template.

Below is an example of the repository structure:

. ├── generic-templates/ │ ├── template-1/ │ │ └── README.md │ └── template-2/ │ └── README.md ├── specific-templates/ │ ├── use-case-1/ │ │ ├── README.md │ │ └── full-tutorial.md │ └── use-case-2/ │ ├── README.md │ └── full-tutorial.md └── README.md
